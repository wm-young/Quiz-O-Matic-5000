# Quiz-O-Matic-5000
The overall task of the learning object was to teach and test mathematical concepts at a specific grade  level. The grades I aimed to focus were grade 9 and grade 10 at the Academic level. The grade 9 information is more towards the material found at the end of the grade 9 course. I found the transition from end of grade 9 into grade 10 ti be smooth and flow nicely with the material.  The information for teaching material was found in The Ontario Curriculum, Grade 9 and 10: Mathematics[1]. Please note that I do not plan on becoming a teacher, I chose the learning object because I already came up with these ideas for the project and thought the best way to apply them was to choose to do learning object.
